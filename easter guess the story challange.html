                <strong>Guess the Story:</strong> In this story, a father was asked to sacrifice his only son on a mountain. At the last moment, God provided a ram caught in a thicket as a substitute. This foreshadows how God would provide His own Son as a sacrifice for our sins.

            <div class="answer" id="answer5">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The Bronze Serpent (Numbers 21:4-9)</p>
                <p><strong>Easter Connection:</strong> Jesus said, "Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him" (John 3:14-15). Like the Israelites were healed by looking at the lifted serpent, we are saved by looking to Christ lifted on the cross.</p>

                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> David and Goliath (1 Samuel 17:1-51)</p>
                <p><strong>Easter Connection:</strong> David's unlikely victory over Goliath prefigures Jesus' victory over sin and death. The humble shepherd boy who became king foreshadows Jesus, the Good Shepherd and King of Kings, born in David's hometown of Bethlehem.</p>

                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Feast of Unleavened Bread (Exodus 12:14-20)</p>
                <p><strong>Easter Connection:</strong> The unleavened bread of this feast foreshadows Jesus, who was without sin (yeast often symbolizes sin). Paul writes, "Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. Therefore let us keep the Festival, not with the old bread leavened with malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth" (1 Corinthians 5:7-8).</p>

                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Cain and Abel (Genesis 4:1-16)</p>
                <p><strong>Easter Connection:</strong> Abel's blood cried out from the ground after his murder. Hebrews 12:24 says the blood of Jesus "speaks a better word than the blood of Abel." While Abel's blood cried for justice, Jesus' blood speaks of forgiveness and redemption.</p>

                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Melchizedek blessing Abraham (Genesis 14:18-20)</p>
                <p><strong>Easter Connection:</strong> Hebrews 7 explains that Jesus is "a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek." The bread and wine Melchizedek brought prefigure communion, and his mysterious appearance without genealogy points to Christ's eternal nature.</p>

                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Joseph (Genesis 37-50)</p>
                <p><strong>Easter Connection:</strong> Joseph was betrayed by his brothers, suffered unjustly, and was later exalted to save his people—paralleling Jesus' betrayal, crucifixion, and resurrection. Joseph told his brothers, "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives" (Genesis 50:20).</p>

                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Manna in the Wilderness (Exodus 16:1-36)</p>
                <p><strong>Easter Connection:</strong> Jesus said, "I am the bread of life. Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died. But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which anyone may eat and not die" (John 6:48-50). The manna foreshadowed Jesus as God's provision for spiritual life.</p>

                <p><strong>Easter Connection:</strong> Just as God sent fire to consume Elijah's sacrifice, showing His acceptance, God demonstrated His acceptance of Jesus' sacrifice through the resurrection. Both events showed God's power over false gods and death itself.</p>

                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Noah and the Ark (Genesis 6-9)</p>
                <p><strong>Easter Connection:</strong> 1 Peter 3:20-21 says, "In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water, and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also—not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ." The ark passing through the flood waters foreshadows how Christians pass from death to life through Christ's resurrection.</p>
